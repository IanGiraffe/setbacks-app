UI
- units toggle should say "meters" and "feet"
- default values for feet should say 40, 25, 5, 10 respectively
- lets modernize the look to our brands neobrutalism style. Note the button with the heavy drop shadow. Lets use tailwind, shadcn and framer motion for slick animations. 
- remove the "Current Settings" card. 
- remove all the UI that should be in the logs instead (project status, ready to generate b uilding envelope). Only show "Boundary not detected" when there is not boundary detected. it should just be a single line of text.
- get rid of the emojies
- for a more compact view, move the labels next to the fields, not above
- remove the (FT) after each label, redundant
- round the containers corners. remove the shadow for the large container. 
-

- When a user edits a field, lets "ungrey" the "Update Building Envelope" button, indicating a change has been made. (first we need to grey it out)
